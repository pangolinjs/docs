# About

Pangolin is a Framework for componentized front end development. It uses _Nunjucks_ for dynamic templates, _Sass_ as a powerful CSS pre-processor, and _Babel_ to transpile modern _JavaScript_ into something parseable by every reasonable browser.

The name _Pangolin_ tries to raise awareness for the [dire situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin) of this fascinating species. It was inspired by the naming of the [invoicing app _Manta_](https://manta.life/about).
