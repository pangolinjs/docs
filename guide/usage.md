# Usage

## Tasks

These are the main tasks:

* `front-end-styleguide` to start the default task.
  * Watches for file changes.
  * Starts Browsersync.
* `front-end-styleguide development` to start the default task
  * No file watching / Browsersync.
* `front-end-styleguide preview` to create a prototype preview.
  * Minifies CSS, JavaScript and images.
  * Doesn't generate component HTML.
  * Errors break pipe.
* `front-end-styleguide production` to create production ready files.
  * Minifies CSS, JavaScript and images.
  * Doesn't generate any HTML.
  * Errors break pipe.

There are more tasks available for standalone execution:

* `css-dev`, `css-prev` and `css-dist` for Sass compilation.
* `css-lint` and `css-lint-break` for CSS linting.
* `js-dev`, `js-prev` and `js-dist` for JavaScript concatenation.
* `js-lint` and `js-lint-break` for JavaScript linting.
* `html-dev` and `html-prev` for static HTML file generation.
* `img-dev`, `img-prev` and `img-dist` for image copying and icon sprite generation.
* `copy-dev`, `copy-prev` and `copy-dist` for copying files from Node modules.

*The generated folders `dev`, `prev` and `dist` are excluded from Git.*


## CSS

Located in `src/css`.  
Output to `dev/css`, `prev/css` or `dist/css`.

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS preprocessor supporting variables, nesting and mixins â€“ among many other features. For a quick start jump to the [Sass Basics](http://sass-lang.com/guide). [stylelint](http://stylelint.io/) monitors the code for errors and consistency deviations.

This styleguide splits the CSS into small parts. This ensures a better organization of style declarations. Each component sits in it's own file and is re-usable across the project. See [HTML](#html) for the HTML-side of componentization.

The function `@import` includes Sass or CSS files in the main Sass file. The final output is one large CSS file to minimize browser requests. See `src/css/main.scss` for more information.

Global [stylelint rules](http://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/) are set in `.stylelintrc.json`. Per-file rules can be set comments (e.g. `/* stylelint-enable selector-max-id */`). With a `.stylelintignore` file in the project root, CSS files can be [excluded from linting](http://stylelint.io/user-guide/configuration/#stylelintignore).

*The development task generates sourcemaps. The preview and production tasks minify the CSS.*


## JavaScript

Located in `src/js`.  
Output to `dev/js`, `prev/js` or `dist/js`.

JavaScript files are bundled together with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and the ES2015 preset. [ESLint](http://eslint.org) checks if the code follows common standards.

Global [ESLint rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) are set in `.eslintrc.json`. Per-file rules can be set with comments (e.g. `/* eslint no-console: "off" */`). With a `.eslintignore` file in the project root, JavaScript files can be [excluded from linting](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#ignoring-files-and-directories). Browserify follows the same `require()` and `modules.exports` system Node uses. This makes loading code from other files or even npm modules very easy. The example setup in `src/js` provides a brief overview of the capabilities.

*The development task generates sourcemaps. The preview and production tasks uglify the source.*


## HTML

Located in `src/html`.  
Output to `dev` or `prev`.

[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is an HTML templating engine based on JavaScript. The styleguide creates static HTML from Handlebars files. [Assemble helpers](https://github.com/assemble/handlebars-helpers) provide more advanced templating features.

Hierarchy with subfolders is supported. The output reflects the input file tree.


### Layouts

Layout helpers provided by [Handlebars Layouts](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-layouts).

Layouts determine the scaffolding of the HTML document. They contain the `<head>` area, the outer `<body>` tags, style and script references.

Layouts are located in `src/html/partials/layouts`.

A minimalistic layout may look like this:

::: v-pre
```handlebars
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{page 'title'}}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{{block "content"}}}
  </body>
</html>
```
:::


### Includes

These files can be included in all other files (even in other includes). The process is comparable to PHP's `include`.

Includes are located in `src/html/partials/includes`.

::: v-pre
The syntax `{{> includes/example}}` includes the file `src/html/partials/includes/example.hbs`.
:::


### Components and Pages

Component pages are references for UI elements. The task `preview` will not render them.

Pages are prototypes for the final web pages.

The `default` and `development` tasks inject a navigation bar into both component and page HTML files for faster site switching and additional settings.

Components are located in `src/html/pages/components`, pages in `src/html/pages`.

::: v-pre
The YAML front matter between the opening `---` and closing `---` contains general information like the title, description and category. These will be used primarily by layouts and the Styleguide navigation. The front matter can be accessed with `{{page "key"}}`. Replace `key` with the name from the front matter.
:::

A simple component page is defined by it's category and the correspondening layout:

::: v-pre
```handlebars
---
title: Example
description: More detailed than the title
category: Components
---
{{#extend "layouts/components"}}
{{#content "body"}}
  <p>This will be injected into the layout.</p>
{{/content}}
{{/extend}}
```
:::

Components may use additional markup within the main body with nicely styled containers:

::: v-pre
```handlebars
{{#embed "styleguide/article" title="Some title" description="Some description text." background="#555"}}
{{#content "body"}}
  <p>The component goes here and will be wrapped in a nicely formatted container.</p>
{{/content}}
{{/embed}}
```
:::

The following parameters are available:

* [optional] `title` sets a heading for the component variation.
* [optional] `description` provides additional information.
* [optional] `background` injects `style="background: value"` into the component.


### Default Variables

::: v-pre
* `{{meta.version}}`: Current styleguide version (e.g. "1.7.0").
* `{{meta.lang}}`: Global project language (e.g. "en").
* `{{meta.dev}}`: Returns true for development task.
* `{{page "title"}}`: Title of the current page.
* `{{page "description"}}`: Description of the current page.
* `{{page "category"}}`: Category of the current page.
* `{{page "filebase"}}`: The name of the current page file without extension (e.g. "index").
* `{{page "filename"}}`: The name of the current page file with extension (e.g. "index.html").
* `{{page "filepath"}}`: Relative path containing the filename of the current page (e.g. "components/header.html").
* `{{page "rel"}}`: Relative path to the root (e.g. "../").
:::


## Images and Icons

Located in `src/img`.  
Output to `dev/img`, `prev/img` or `dist/img`.

All files and folders placed in `src/img` will be copied to `dev/img`, `prev/img` or `dist/img`.

SVG files placed in the `src/img/icons` folder will be transformed into an [SVG icon sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/gulp-svg-sprite) named `icons.svg`. The original icons will *not* be copied to output folders. SVG symbols can be referenced with their ID. The icon workflow creates IDs from the filename of the original SVG placed in `src/img/icons`. Each ID is suffixed with "-icon" for better compatibility with browsers that need a polyfill.

Icons can be used in HTML with the following syntax:

```twig
<svg width="24" height="24">
  <use xlink:href="{{page 'rel'}}img/icons.svg#filename-icon"></use>
</svg>
```

Specifying dimensions is considered good style. Without a defined width and height browsers often scale SVGs to fill the whole viewport. This happens if dimensions set in CSS fail to load.

The styleguide ships with [svgxuse](https://github.com/Keyamoon/svgxuse), a polyfill for browsers that do not support external SVG reference.

*The preview and production tasks minify images with a lossless compressor.*


## Copy

Files that don't fit in the above mentioned categories can be integrated into the styleguide with the file `src/copy.js`. To integrate files from Node modules, simply install the module with `npm install --save-dev module-name` and add files or folders to `copy.js`.

`copy.js` contains an array of objects. Each object is a copy instruction and has a `folder`, `files`, `dest` and optional `exclude` key.

* `folder` is the base path.
* `files` specifies which files and folders will be copied. The folder structure will be kept (e.g. `dist/**` results in `dev/js/dist/**`). Use [globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) to copy more than one file.
* `dest` sets the destination for the copy process. The development, preview and production tasks each prefix the destination with their specific output folders (e.g. `dev/` for development). Base path variables from `config/paths.js` can be used (`path.css.base`, `path.js.base`, `path.html.base` and `path.img.base`). But feel free to set arbitrary destinations.
* [optional] `excludes` contains a string or an array of strings with names for tasks that will not perform the copy instruction. Available task names are `dev`, `prev` and `dist`.

Beware of overwriting files from other tasks (e.g. `css/styles.css`), the copy task is started last. Due to asynchronous task execution the exact write order is unknown.

### Copy single files

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    folder: 'node_modules/svgxuse',
    files: 'svgxuse.{js,min.js}',
    dest: paths.js.base,
    exclude: 'dist'
  }
];
```

This declaration copies the files `node_modules/svgxuse/svgxuse.js` and `node_modules/svgxuse/svgxuse.min.js` to `taskfolder/js/svgxuse.js` and `taskfolder/js/svgxuse.min.js`. `taskfolder` is either `dev` or `prev` depending on the task. The `dist` task is excluded.

### Preserve original folder structure

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    folder: 'node_modules/@polymer',
    files: '**',
    dest: 'polymer'
  }
];
```

Everything from `node_modules/@polymer` will be copied to `taskfolder/polymer`. Subfolders will be kept as is.

### Remove original folder structure

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    folder: 'node_modules/@polymer/font-roboto',
    files: '**',
    dest: 'polymer'
  }
];
```

Everything from `node_modules/@polymer/font-roboto` will be copied to `taskfolder/polymer`. No `font-roboto` folder will be created.
