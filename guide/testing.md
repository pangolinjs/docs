# Testing

The project comes pre-configured with the [AVA test runner](https://github.com/avajs/ava) â€“ a lightning fast framework for JavaScript unit tests. All test files should end on `*.unit.js`. Tests should be placed next to the tested code (e.g. in `src/functions` or `src/components`).

Pangolin doesn't prescribe the testing framework. If you don't like AVA you can swap it for any other framework.
