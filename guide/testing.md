# Testing

All test specification files should end with `*.unit.js`. Tests should be placed next to the tested code (e.g. in `src/functions` or `src/components`) to show the relationship.

However, Pangolin doesn't prescribe the testing framework nor the test spec names. A few nice test runners are:

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
* [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io)
* [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
