# About

Pangolin.js is a Framework for design system development. It uses _Nunjucks_ for HTML templates (using [Fractal](https://fractal.build) under the hood); _Sass_ as a powerful CSS pre-processor; and _webpack_ to bundle JavaScript into a single file for the browser.

The name _Pangolin_ tries to raise awareness for the [dire situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin) of this fascinating species.
