# Introduction

Pangolin is a framework for componentized front end development with Nunjucks, Sass and JavaScript. It helps building a pattern library for web projects of all scales â€” small, medium, and large.

The framework recently changed its name to _Pangolin_ which is much shorter than the previous _Front End Styleguide_. The intention of the new name is to raise awareness for the [dire situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin) of this fascinating species.
